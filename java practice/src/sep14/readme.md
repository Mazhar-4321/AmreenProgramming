**Writing logic separately**
* Dont write logic in main method always use main method as gateway

  **Approach a problem** 
1. Gather data 
1. decide the elements of programming language
1. ***learn the difference between override,update,initialize***
1. ***Learn the loops in forward and reverse directions***

***Home Work***

* Run loop from 1 to n and print all the elements that are factors of 3 .Eg : 1 to 10?  o/p : 3,6,9
* Run loop from m to n and print all the elements that are factors of 4 . Eg m=4? n=10?  o/p : 8
* Run loop from m to n and print all the elements that are factors of k . Eg m=4? n=10? k=3? o/p :6,9
* Run nested loops and practice patterns of class
